# CRUD Application in React
Tasker is an intuitive task management system designed for everyone. It enables easy creation and management of tasks with features such as task creation (title, desc, tags, due date, priority, owner), task listing, powerful search with 'debounce' for an enhanced experience, task categorization (by tag, priority, owner), marking tasks as favorites, tracking and updating task status, task editing, and efficient task deletion. Could you simplify your task management with Tasker?

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
